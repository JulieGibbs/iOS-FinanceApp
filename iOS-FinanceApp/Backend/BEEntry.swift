     'dynamic' engages the dynamic method dispatch to deal with the property (theory below)
     - method dispatch: mechanism that selects the appropriate method implementation to be called, breaks down in following types:
     - dynamic dispatch: engaged on runtime, thus some overhead, breaks down in two types:
     - table (virtual) dispatch: creates the witness (virtual) table (an array of function pointers) ~> looks up appropriate implemetation address. Performs in 3 steps:
     (1) read the pointer address,
     (2) jump to the address location,
     (3) perform instruction (faster than message dispatch)
     - message dispatch: most dynamic way of invocation, it's behavior can be altered at runtime (method swizzling),
     - static (direct) dispatch: instruction locations detected @ compile time, compiler accesses instruction directly (fast, but slower than inline dispatch) so no overhead ar run time bc func overriding is not allowed in this case ~> no need to make a table
     - inline dispatch (fastest): (@inline) - inlining the code into the dispatch [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
